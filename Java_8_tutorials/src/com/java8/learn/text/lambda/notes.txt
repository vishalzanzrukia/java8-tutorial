A lambda expression is a method without a name that is used to pass around behavior as if it were
data.

Lambda expressions look like this: BinaryOperator<Integer> add = (x, y) â†’ x + y.

A functional interface is an interface with a single abstract method that is used as the type of a
lambda expression.
